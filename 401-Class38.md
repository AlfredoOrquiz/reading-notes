Why use Redux middleware?
  By itself, a Redux store doesn't know anything about async logic. It only knows how to synchronously dispatch actions, update the state by calling the root reducer function, and notify the UI that something has changed. Any asynchronicity has to happen outside the store.
Why would you need redux-thunk middleware?
  As it turns out, Redux already has an official version of that "async function middleware", called the Redux "Thunk" middleware.
Redux Thunk middleware allows you to write action creators that return a dispatch instead of an action.
