What is the first principle of Redux?
  The global state of an app is stored within an object tree in a single store. As a result, it becomes easier to build universal apps due to the server’s state being serialized into the client without any extra codes.
what is a store and what do we use our reducers for within that store?
  A store is a state container which holds the application’s state. Redux can have only a single store in your application.
Name three Redux store methods given to us by createStore and describe their use.
  getState()
  dispatch(action)
  subscribe(listener)
  replaceReducer(nextReducer)
