A graph is a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of vertices (or nodes) potentially connected by line segments named edges.
In the graph, there are directed, and undirected.
Directed graphs are also called digraphs, every edge is direct, and has direction.
Undirected Graph is a graph where each edge is undirected or bi-directional. This means that the undirected graph does not move in any direction.
A complete graph is when all nodes are connected to all other nodes.
A connected graph is graph that has all of vertices/nodes have at least one edge.
A disconnected graph is a graph where some vertices may not have edges.
An acyclic graph is a directed graph without cycles. A cycle is when a node can be traversed through and potentially end up back at itself.
A Cyclic graph is a graph that has cycles. A cycle is defined as a path of a positive length that starts and ends at the same vertex.
