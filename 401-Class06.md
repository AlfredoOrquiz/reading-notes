Explain to a non-technical friend how you would safely hash and store a password.
  I would take in your password, give it to the computer to encode it, and then encrypt it by hiding the password, and not letting it be shown to anyone. And in the slight chance that someone breaks into the passwords, the password is encoded with other codes, and they are shuffled, so no one can decoded easily.
What is Bcrypt?
Bcrypt is an adaptive hash function based on the Blowfish symmetric block cipher cryptographic algorithm and introduces a work factor
Why might you use something like Bcrypt?
Used to overcome such issues, we need algorithms which can make the brute force attacks slower and minimize the impact.



What is Basic Authentication?
basic access authentication is a method for an HTTP user agent to provide a user name and password when making a request.
