What is the single responsibility principle and how does it apply to components? It's where a component should ideally only do one thing. If it ends up growing, it should be decomposed into smaller subcomponents.
What does it mean to build a ‘static’ version of your application? It is  is a compiled version of a program which has been statically linked against libraries.
Once you have a static application, what do you need to add? You can either start with building the components higher up in the hierarchy (i.e. starting with FilterableProductTable) or with the ones lower in it (ProductRow).
What are the three questions you can ask to determine if something is state?
  Is it passed in from a parent via props? If so, it probably isn’t state.
  Does it remain unchanged over time? If so, it probably isn’t state.
  Can you compute it based on any other state or props in your component? If so, it isn’t state.
How can you identify where state needs to live?


What is a “higher-order function”?
Explore the greaterThan function as defined in the reading. In your own words, what is line 2 of this function doing?
Explain how either map or reduce operates, with regards to higher-order functions.
