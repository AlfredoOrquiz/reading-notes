Classes are a template for creating Objects.
Can a class declaration be hoisted?
Yes
How would you describe a constructor and contextual “this” to a non-technical friend?
Say we want to build many cars. We will create a template of the car by stating the make, model, and year. Instead of repeating the same task over and over again, we can build a machine that will do the same basic task instead of humans. That is what a constructor does.



Within Express, what does routing refer to?
It refers to how an application’s endpoints (URIs) respond to client requests. For an introduction to routing, see Basic routing.

What is the difference between a route path and a route method?
  Route paths, in combination with a request method, define the endpoints at which requests can be made.
  Route method is derived from one of the HTTP methods, and is attached to an instance of the express class.
When is it appropriate to add next as a parameter to a route handler and what must you do if next has been passed to your middleware as a parameter?
The only exception is that these callbacks might invoke next('route') to bypass the remaining route callbacks.



What is an Express Router?
It is a mini express application without all the bells and whistles of an express application, just the routing stuff.
By what mean do we initialize express.Router() in an express server?
What do we use route middleware for?
This could be things like checking if a user is authenticated, logging data for analytics, or anything else we’d like to do before we actually spit out information to our user.
