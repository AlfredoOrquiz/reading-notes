What was the motivation for introducing Hooks?
Hooks solve a wide variety of seemingly unconnected problems in React that we’ve encountered over five years of writing and maintaining tens of thousands of components.
What changes are important regarding implementing Hooks versus Component Classes?
Completely opt-in. You can try Hooks in a few components without rewriting any existing code. But you don’t have to learn or use Hooks right now if you don’t want to.
100% backwards-compatible. Hooks don’t contain any breaking changes.
Available now. Hooks are now available with the release of v16.8.0.
Hooks allow you to reuse stateful logic without changing your component hierarchy.




Name two rules imposed by React Hook usage.
Only call Hooks at the top level. Don’t call Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions.
Only call Hooks from React function components. Don’t call Hooks from regular JavaScript functions. (There is just one other valid place to call Hooks — your own custom Hooks. We’ll learn about them in a moment.)
How would you identify a custom Hook and why might you create one?
Custom Hooks are more of a convention than a feature. If a function’s name starts with ”use” and it calls other Hooks, we say it is a custom Hook. The useSomething naming convention is how our linter plugin is able to find bugs in the code using Hooks.




What is a Hook?
A Hook is a special function that lets you “hook into” React features. 
When would I use the useState Hook?
If you write a function component and realize you need to add some state to it, previously you had to convert it to a class.
If you were to add React state to a function component by declaring a state variable:
What does calling useState do?
It declares a “state variable”. Our variable is called count but we could call it anything else.
What do we pass to useState as an argument?
Unlike with classes, the state doesn’t have to be an object. We can keep a number or a string if that’s all we need.
What does useState return?
It returns a pair of values: the current state and a function that updates it.
