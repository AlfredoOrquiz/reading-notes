Who is Roy Fielding? He helped write the first web servers, that sent documents across the internet.
Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?
What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created? It is like a GPS, it is a directory that gets the address of computors around the world.
What does a GET do? It requests a specific resource in its entirety
What does a POST do? It adds content, messages, or data to a new page under an existing web resource
What does PUT do? It directly modifies an existing web resource or creates a new URI if need be
What does PATCH do? It partially modifies a web resource
