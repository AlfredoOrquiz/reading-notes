Why create multiple reducers?
  Having one large reducer function that changes many different parts of the state would be hard to debug and maintain

How would you combine multiple reducers?
  create separate reducer functions for each part of the state
  use the combineReducer function from redux, and pass all the reducers as a parameter

How will you manage state as an immutable object? why?
  override the current state object and create a new one with destructuring every time



CombineReducers is a utility function to simplify the most common use case when writing Redux reducers .
Explain how combineReducers assembles the new state tree.
  combineReducers will call each slice reducer with its current slice of state and the current action, giving the slice reducer a chance to respond and update its slice of state if needed. 
How would you define initial state in an app using combineReducers?

Why will you want to split your reducing functions as your app becomes more complex?
As your app grows more complex, you'll want to split your reducing function into separate functions, each managing independent parts of the state. The combineReducers helper function turns an object whose values are different reducing functions into a single reducing function you can pass to createStore.

What is a popular convention when naming reducers? Name reducers after the state slices they manage.
