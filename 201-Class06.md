How would you describe an object to a non-technical friend you grew up with? An object in coding is literally what it says in its name. An object is a sentence, a name of a person, tool, etc., that you can use later when you call it.

What are some advantages to creating object literals? They are easier to reference than arryas.

How do objects differ from arrays? Objects represent specific data or information. Arrays are a particular type of variable that is best used when elements are numbers.

Give an example of when you would need to use bracket notation to access an object's property instead of dot notation. If an object property name is defined at runtime, then you can't use the dot notation to access the value, but you can pass the name as a variable inside brackets.

Evaluate the code below. What does the term this refer to, and what is the advantage of using this? For this question, I believe it has already been answered accidentally.
const dog = {
  name: 'Spot',
  age: 2,
  color: 'white with black spots',
  humanAge: function (){
    console.log(`${this.name} is ${this.age*7} in human years`);
  }
}
This refers to the object dog. And it is usefull because you are 
letting the computer know that you are grabbing aa property without leaving
the object, like an array.



What is the DOM? The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content.

Briefly describe the relationship between the DOM and JavaScript. JavaScript uses the DOM to access the document and its elements. The DOM is not a programming language, but without it, the JavaScript language wouldn't have any model or notion of web pages, HTML documents, SVG documents, and their component parts.
