Name three Core Components of React Native and describe what they do.

What problem does React Native solve (why call it native)?
  It supports plenty of modules and APIs, which makes the development process much easier and faster
What are the building blocks of a React Native app?
  Text and View are the two most basic building blocks of any React Native application. 



What solution does expo provide?
  Expo provides a set of APIs and utilities to improve the process of developing native modules for Expo and React Native and expand your app capabilities.
Expo tries to manage as much of the complexity of building apps as possible, which is why we call it the managed workflow.
What is the difference between React Native and Expo?
  In short, React Native is the framework that allows developers to write Native code for mobile applications using JavaScript. Expo is a set of tools that facilitates development in React Native. 


What does “eject” mean within the context of Expo?
  If you created an Expo project and you want a way to add custom native modules, this guide will explain how to use ExpoKit for that purpose.
When should you not eject?
  All you need is to distribute your app in the iTunes Store or Google Play. Expo can build binaries for you in that case. If you eject, we can't automatically build for you any more.
  You are uncomfortable writing native code. Ejected apps will require you to manage Xcode and Android Studio projects.
Why might you choose to eject?
  Your Expo project needs a native module that Expo doesn't currently support. We're always expanding the Expo SDK, so we hope this is never the case. But it happens, especially if your app has very specific and uncommon native demands.
