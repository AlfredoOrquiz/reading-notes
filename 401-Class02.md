Explain middleware, answer as though I were a non-technical recruiter. Middleware is like an action that you give to the computer to go to a rute. Imagine you are given directions to buy milk at a walmart, and you were given the directions. Once you arrive, you find a target, and not a walmart. You will be lost. That is basically what middleware will do. It needs an action, and most importantly, a location.
Express the most popular Node web framework.
Express is “unopinionated.” What does that mean? You can insert any compatible middleware you like into the request handling chain, in almost any order.
What is a module and why is modularity useful to us as developers? Module is a JavaScript library or file ini which you can import into another code with Node require() function. It is like a box that you can put in another box.


What version of npm are you running on your machine? 8.19.1
What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’ into your node project? npm install -g jshint


Explain why tests are important. Please explain as though I were your non technical elder. You would want to make sure that the vehivcle that you are working on is working every single step on the way, instead of building a car, and wait till the end to see if it works, right?
What are three expected benefits of testing.
  Teams reports significant reductions in defect rates
  Report that overheads are more than offset by a reduction in effort
  Improved design qualities
Name at lest 2 individual pitfalls and at least 2 team pitfalls commonly encountered while writing tests.
  Writing too many tests at once
  Writing tests that are too large or coarse-grained


What are three benefits of Continuous Integration? 
  Ensures everyone's changes integrate
  Catches bugs
  Reduces Merge Conflicts
What is the difference between Continuos Delivery and Continuous Deployment?
  Continuous Delivery is a software engineering approach in which teams produce software in short cycles, ensuring that the software can be reliably released at any time and, when releasing the software, without doing so manually.
  Continuous Deployment is an application release process that uses automated testing to dispatch final code changes to production.
Explain how GitHub fits into this process assuming the listener comes from a non-technical background.
Imagine you are working with a team to build a car. You all know how it will look, what it will do, etc. All the plan is aid out for you. Now it is time to build it. You all agree on what team is going to do what.Who will be building the frame, who will deal with all of the electronics, who will deal with the code, etc. Everyone agrees with the plan of the day on what you all will do. You all go and do your own work, come back at the end of the day, and implement your portion of the work to the veihle. And liitle by little, you build the car. That is how github is involved in this process.
