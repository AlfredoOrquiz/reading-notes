With regard to the React Context API, what does a “provider” do?
Provier is responsible for both displaying the local state of the snackbars (we call them alerts), and for exposing an API for globally managing them.
With regard to the React Context API, how would we implement a “consumer” role?
Our custom hook from before is nothing more than a small wrapper around the useContext internal React hook, which consumes our new context.
Specifically with Context, how are we “wrapping” components to achieve our goals?
  Create context using the createContext method.
  Take your created context and wrap the context provider around your component tree.
  Put any value you like on your context provider using the value prop.
  Read that value within any component by using the context consumer.
