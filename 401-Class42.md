Computing professionals' actions change the world. To act responsibly, they should reflect upon the wider impacts of their work, consistently supporting the public good.
The ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct ("the Code") expresses the conscience of the profession.
The Code as a whole is concerned with how fundamental ethical principles apply to a computing professional's conduct.
The Code is not an algorithm for solving ethical problems; rather it serves as a basis for ethical decision-making.
When thinking through a particular issue, a computing professional may find that multiple principles should be taken into account, and that different principles will have different relevance to the issue.
This principle, which concerns the quality of life of all people, affirms an obligation of computing professionals, both individually and collectively, to use their skills for the benefit of society, its members, and the environment surrounding them.
This obligation includes promoting fundamental human rights and protecting each individual's right to autonomy.
