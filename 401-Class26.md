What are the building blocks of a React app?
  JSX
  Components
  State and props
  Conditional rendering
What is the difference between an element and a React component?
React Elements:
  1) A React Element is what gets returned from components. It’s an object that virtually describes the DOM nodes that a component represents.
  2) With a function component, this element is the object that the function returns.
  3) With a class component, the element is the object that the component’s render function returns.
React Components:
  1) A component is a function or a Class which optionally accepts input and returns a React element.
  2) A React Component is a template. A blueprint. A global definition. This can be either a function or a class (with a render function).
What are some advantages of React’s component based architecture?
  It is composable.
  It is declarative.
  Write once, learn anywhere.
  It is simple.
  SEO friendly.
  Fast, efficient, and easy to learn.



What is JSX and why do we use it?
React embraces the fact that rendering logic is inherently coupled with other UI logic: how events are handled, how the state changes over time, and how the data is prepared for display.
Describe the process of embedding JavaScript expressions in JSX.
In the example below, we declare a variable called name and then use it inside JSX by wrapping it in curly braces:



Describe mutability and React Components, specifically, how is the UI updated?
React elements are immutable. Once you create an element, you can’t change its children or attributes. An element is like a single frame in a movie: it represents the UI at a certain point in time.
If changes are made to the UI, what does React update?
React DOM compares the element and its children to the previous one, and only applies the DOM updates necessary to bring the DOM to the desired state.
