Explain how the ability to use video and audio on the web has evolved since the early 2000s. In the early days, native web technologies such as HTML didn't have the ability to embed video and audio on the Web, so proprietary (or plugin-based) technologies like Flash — and later, Silverlight (both of which are now obsolete) — became popular for handling such content. Pretty much, a lot has been done for improvements. The quality, resolution, and the graphics have come a long way since the begining of the internet video and audion.

Describe the use of the src and controls attributes in the video element. In the same way as for the img element, the src (source) attribute contains a path to the video you want to embed. It works in exactly the same way.

Why is it important to have fallback content inside the video element? this will be displayed if the browser accessing the page doesn't support the <video> element, allowing us to provide a fallback for older browsers. This can be anything you like; in this case, we've provided a direct link to the video file, so the user can at least access it some way regardless of what browser they are using.

Write a very short story where audio and video are characters.
