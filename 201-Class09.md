How would you describe events to a non-technical friend? It is like when you enter a website, and conffetti or hearts come falling down the page.

When using the addEventListener() method, what 2 arguments will you need to provide? The name of the event and a function to handle the event.

Describe the event object. Why is the target within the event object useful? The event object is automatically passed to event handlers to provide extra features and information. The target property of the event object is always a reference to the element the event occurred upon.

What is the difference between event bubbling and event capturing? Event bubbling is where the event handlers are invoked when one element is nested on to the other element and are part of the same event. Event capturing is where an event moves from the outermost element to the target.
