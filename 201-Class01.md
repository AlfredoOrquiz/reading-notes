Compose a short poem describing how HTTP sends data between computers. I am not going to write a poem. I will give a short answer though. A web browser is an HTTP client that sends requests to servers. When the browser user enters file requests by either "opening" a web file by typing in a URL or clicking on a hypertext link, the browser builds an HTTP request and sends it to the Internet Protocol address indicated by the URL.

Describe how HTML, CSS, and JS files are “parsed” in the browser. The browser parses the HTML file first, and that leads to the browser recognizing any link element references to external CSS stylesheets and any script element references to scripts.

What is an HTML attribute? HTML is a computer language composed of elements, dictating whether a page has a header, bulletins, paragraphs, etc. It is, in short, the structure of a web page, and it can be as straightforward or as complex as one wants it to be.

Describe the Anatomy of an HTML element. An HTML element has three components; an opening tag, the content, and the closing tag. The opening tag consists of the component's name, which states whether the emelent is a paragraph, a headliner, a bulletin list, etc. The content is what is being presented. The closing tag is almost the same as an opening tag, just informing the computer that the tag has ended.

What is the Difference between article and section element tags? The element tag article and section are used to group up content together. However, article represents a self-contained composition, something that can stand alone. Onthe other hand, section element tags are generic standalone section of a document, which doesn't have a more specific semantic element to represent it.

What is the first step in designing a Website? When creating a website, you want to have an idea as to what your website to do. Knowing the ins and outs of building a website is nice, but if you don't see the website's goal or how it will look, it is as good as learning how to play the guitar but not knowing how to create music. You first become a musician or a painter by brushing, strumming, or making music, and as you create, you then learn the technique. The same concept applies to web designing. Knowing all the tools is pointless without visualizing what your website will look like.

What is the most critical question to answer when designing a Website? What exactly do I want to accomplish? How will a website help me reach my goals? What needs to be done, and in what order, to reach my goals?



Why should you use an h1 element over a span piece to display a top-level heading? Element tag h1 is semantic and has the role of being a heading. Search engines will also consider its contents as important keywords to influence the page's search rankings. Suggests to the developer the type of data that will be populated. Element tag span doesn't have the role of being a header but can look like one. However, it doesn't have the same benefits as a semantic as h1.

What are the benefits of using semantic tags in our HTML? Using h1 in HTML for semantics gives the content that it is wrapping a heading role. 



Describe two things that require JavaScript in the browser?
