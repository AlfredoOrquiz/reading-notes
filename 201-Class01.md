# HTML is a computer language that is composed of elements, dictating weather a page has a header, bulletins, parragraphs, etc. It is in short, the structure of a web page, and it can be as simple, or as complex as one wants it to be.

# An HTML element has 3 components; and opening tag, the content, and the closing tag. The opening tag consists of the name of the element, meaning that it is stating weather the emelent is a parragraph, a headliner, a bulletin list, etc. The content is what is being presented. The closing tag is almost the same as an opening tag, just informing the computer that the tag has ended.
