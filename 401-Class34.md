Explain the different between a query string parameter and a path parameter.
  Path parameters show where to look and query string parameters might show what to look at.
What would our API URL with a path id parameter be given the following information:
1.- Domain: http://our-site.com
2.- v3
3.- model name: stuff
4.- id: things
  It would go the to domain, use the v3 API, operate on the stuff model, and look for things.
We have created a dynamic API with an “interface”. Describe how that interface works to a non-technical friend.
You put in data you want to do something with, then pick which method to operate on, then hit GO!



Describe how you would use middleware to implement basic and bearer auth.
When a user initiates a CRUD request on our server, we route them to the authorization middleware and validate their credentials for permissions.
Describe the handshake necessary to implement OAuth.
When a user makes a request to our /oauth route, we send their credentials to a third-party and get back a success, or an error. If successful, we create or update a local user account in our database and return an auth token, as well as the user object.
Describe how Role Based Access Control works to a non-technical friend.
RBAC is like when you go into the art museum and try to take the paintings off the wall and they get mad. Your role doesn’t have the necessary permissions for that.
