What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?
Honestly, I am not the sharpest tool in the shed. I need a lot to learn in order to work smart. But what I lack in working smart, I make up for it in working hard. I am the most hardworking person you will ever meet, and I will figure out the answer one way or another.

What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?
  I will ask for help. Unfortunately, I always need help whenever people are going to bed.
  I will take a break, walk away from the computer.
  I will have some sort of device to release my anger/stress (walk around, get a stress ball, or if I work from home, get a punching bag)

## Things I want to know more about
One needs to learn how to manage their time better. I am working on this, and that is why I need to sacrifice my time now in order to have more time in the future by getting in a career that pays more.
