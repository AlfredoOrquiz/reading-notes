Code-Fellows reading notes
Good afternoon. My name is Alfredo Orquiz. I was born in Lincoln, Nebraska, but was raised in Cd. Juarez, Chihuahua, Mexico. I was living in California working as a    mechanic, and moved here to Seattle with the goal of becoming a software engineer. My laptop is a Windows 10. I am expecting to learn a lot about software, coding, and about computers in this class, and to implement what I learn in the real world with machinery, robotics, or design websites.
