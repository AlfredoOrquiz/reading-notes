Name an alternative to the useState Hook.
  useReducer
Why might the useReducer Hook be preferable to the useState Hook?
  Accepts a reducer of type (state, action) => newState, and returns the current state paired with a dispatch method.
What are two ways to set the initial state?
  The simplest way is to pass the initial state as a second argument.
  pass an init function as the third argument. The initial state will be set to init(initialArg).




In terms of state, what does useReducer expect to receive as a parameter?
  The first parameter is the current state, and the second is the action.
What does useReducer return?
  useReducer returns an array that holds the current state value and a dispatchmethod that logically achieves the same goal as setState, updating the state.
